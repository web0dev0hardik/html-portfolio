<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Hardik Singh, a passionate and creative designer with a keen eye for detail and a love for transforming ideas into visually compelling designs. I have completed a comprehensive design course on Udemy : <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-web-designer-mobile-designer-zero-to-mastery/learn/lecture/33196356#overview"> "Complete Web & Mobile Designer: UI/UX, Figma, +more"
</a>, where I honed my skills in figma, UX/UI design, typography, color theory, HTML and CSS. </p>
<p>Although I am at the beginning of my professional journey, I have developed a strong portfolio through personal projects. I am eager to apply my knowledge and creativity to real-world projects and continue growing as a designer. </p>
